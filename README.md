### D3 Visualization: Places Traveled

This gist was originally created to illustrate the data scrubbing process, and all files are associated with my <a href="http://www.kgryte.com/blog/d3-visualization-places-traveled/">blog post</a> under the same name.

The file progression proceeds from <code>data.txt</code>, a simple text document which contains a list of places, to formatting this original data set as GeoJSON, <code>data.geojson</code>.

Once formatted as GeoJSON, we use <a href="http://www.d3js.org">D3.js</a> to visualize the data, drawing inspiration from similar visualizations utilizing the same framework.
